## Architecture Summary
The proposed architecture is designed to handle the complex requirements of a modern wealth management platform with a focus on security, scalability, and integration. Utilizing Azure cloud services, the architecture leverages Java-based microservices with Spring Boot for the backend, ensuring lightweight, modular, and easily scalable components. React JS is used on the frontend to provide a responsive and modern user interface. The system incorporates robust security measures including end-to-end encryption, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and integration with existing KYC/AML systems for compliance. The architecture is designed to support up to 1,000 concurrent users initially, with the ability to scale up to handle 10,000 users within the next five years as per the performance benchmarks set in the requirements.

## System Components
- **User Management Service**: Handles user account creation, setup, and configuration using Spring Boot.
- **Authentication Service**: Implements OAuth 2.0 for secure access and supports MFA.
- **KYC/AML Integration Service**: Connects with external KYC/AML systems to verify user identity and ensure compliance.
- **CRM Integration Service**: Ensures that user data is synchronized with existing CRM systems.
- **Frontend Application**: Developed using React JS, provides interactive and user-friendly interfaces for account management and configuration.
