### Architecture Summary:

The architecture for the Wealth and Asset Management Firm's Onboarding and Registration solution is designed to be secure, scalable, and compliant with financial regulations, leveraging Azure cloud services, React JS, and Java Spring Boot. The system features a front-end built with React JS for a responsive user interface, interacting with backend Java-based microservices hosted in Azure App Service. These microservices handle various business processes such as account creation, MFA, and integration with KYC/AML services. Azure SQL Database is used for data storage, ensuring encrypted data at rest and in transit. Azure Active Directory (AAD) is employed for robust identity management with OAuth 2.0 for secure API access. The architecture includes a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps for streamlined deployments and maintenance.
